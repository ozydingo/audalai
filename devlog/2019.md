Create new Rails app in `server` folder. Get Rails 6 rc1:

```
echo "gem 'rails', '~> 6.0.0.rc1'" >> Gemfile
bundle install

rails new . --force --skip-bundle
bundle update
```

`rails new` apparently creates a .git folder, so

```
rm -rf .git
```

Install puma-dev, follow instructions.

ERROR: `You must use Bundler 2 or greater with this lockfile.` This may be responsible for downstream errors that are preventing me from running rails s or puma.

Adding `gem 'bundler', '~> 2.0.1'` does not work; `bundler -v` still returns `1.17.2`. But `bundle exec bundler -v` returns `2.0.1`. `bundle exec rails s` still fails:

ERROR: `Webpacker configuration file not found /Users/andrew/code/apps/audalai/server/config/webpacker.yml. Please run rails webpacker:install`

-> `bundle exec rake webpacker:install`

ERROR: `Yarn not installed. Please download and install Yarn from https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/`

-> Remove webpacker, turbolinks from Gemfile. Success.

ERROR:

Blocked host: audalai.test

To allow requests to audalai.test, add the following to your environment configuration:
config.hosts << "audalai.test"
```

Add to application.rb, `touch tmp/rextart.txt`. Success. Add `if Rails.env == "development"`.
